# ‚ú® Three.js Path Recorder ‚ú®

A simple web application demonstrating path recording and visualization in a 3D environment using Three.js. Supports both Desktop (Mouse/Keyboard) and WebXR (VR) interaction, automatically detecting the best mode available.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Real-time Path Recording:** Capture the user's movement path within the 3D scene.
*   **Path Visualization:** Draw the recorded paths as colored lines on the ground plane. Each path gets a unique color gradient.
*   **Dual Mode:**
    *   **Desktop Mode:** Control movement with WASD/Arrow keys and look around with the mouse (using Pointer Lock).
    *   **VR Mode:** Interact using WebXR-compatible VR headsets and controllers.
*   **Automatic Mode Detection:** Checks for WebXR support and initializes the appropriate controls and UI instructions.
*   **Adjustable Sample Rate (Desktop):** Change the frequency at which position data is recorded using the mouse wheel.
*   **Simple UI:** On-screen display showing recording status, sample rate, and basic controls. Toast notifications provide feedback on actions.
*   **Modular Code:** Project structured with ES Modules for better organization (Scene setup, Renderer, Controls, UI Manager).
*   **Vite Powered:** Uses Vite for fast development and optimized builds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
4.  **Open your browser:** Navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

## üéÆ Usage / Controls

The application will automatically detect if your browser and system support WebXR.

**Desktop Mode:**

*   **Look:** Click on the screen to lock the mouse pointer and look around. Press `ESC` to unlock.
*   **Move:** Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or the Arrow Keys.
*   **Record:** Press the `R` key to start recording your path. Press `R` again to stop recording and draw the path.
*   **Adjust Sample Rate:** Use the Mouse Wheel while the pointer is *not* locked. A lower value (e.g., 50ms) means more frequent samples (smoother path, more data), a higher value (e.g., 1000ms) means less frequent samples. Changes take effect immediately if recording, or on the next recording session.

**VR Mode (WebXR):**

*   **Enter VR:** Click the "Enter VR" button that appears (requires a connected VR headset and compatible browser).
*   **Move:** Movement is typically handled by your VR system's standard locomotion (e.g., joystick on controllers, teleportation - this demo doesn't implement specific VR locomotion, it relies on headset tracking).
*   **Record:** Press the **Trigger button** on either VR controller to start recording. Press the Trigger again to stop recording and draw the path.
*   **Fallback Record:** The `R` key on the physical keyboard can also be used as a fallback to start/stop recording while in VR.

## üí° Technology Stack

*   **Three.js:** Core 3D rendering library.
*   **Vite:** Frontend build tool and development server.
*   **JavaScript (ES Modules):** Application logic.
*   **HTML5 / CSS3:** Structure and basic styling.
*   **WebXR Device API:** For Virtual Reality support.

## üîÆ Potential Future Improvements

*   Save/Load recorded paths (e.g., to LocalStorage or a file).
*   Export path data (JSON, CSV).
*   More complex scene environments.
*   Path editing or smoothing options.
*   UI for selecting, viewing, or deleting multiple recorded paths.
*   Implement specific VR locomotion options (teleport, joystick movement).
